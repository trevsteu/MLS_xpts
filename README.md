# MLS_xpts
In this repo I have created an expected points table based on data from the 2025 MLS Regular Season. 

The html webpage can be viewed at https://trevsteu.github.io/MLS_xpts/index.html

This is a work in progress for now, I will update it as I have the time. One of my plans is to create an RShiny App for this project.
