# Motivation:

Note that his project is a work in progress. I will update as I have the time.

# Setup:

```{r, results = "hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
library(reactable)
```

# Code:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- str_glue("https://fbref.com/en/comps/22/schedule/Major-League-Soccer-Scores-and-Fixtures")

n <- 1000 # number of times to simulate each match
set.seed(2025) # for reproducibility


html <- read_html(url)
html_table <- html |> 
  html_element("table") |> 
  html_table() 

head(html_table)
